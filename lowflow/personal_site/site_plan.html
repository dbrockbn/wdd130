    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Clean, useable water is such an important resource! One we often take for granted.  In the area where I live there is a drought, and there has been for decades. Have you ever thought what it would be like to have a very limited supply of clean water for your use? What would happen if we couldn’t quickly go to the sink and get water to drink or to wash our hands? My goal is to identify ways to easily conserve water. I want my website to demonstrate through word, picture, and video; ways to conserve water. I would also like to sell products to help facilitate conserving water. Some of those products would be: 1-clay pitcher like pots that you bury in the ground and then fill with water, to keep the roots of nearby plants moist (This lessens the need to water from above and creates less wasted water). 2-hardware to create rain barrel systems to collect rainwater. 3- Water purifying devices.  I would also show ways to plant which require less watering. Some examples are hügelkultur or xeriscaping. Also including native and/or drought resistant plants will help as well. There are many ways to conserve water for ourselves for emergencies and/or personal use, while still creating a beautiful garden, or yard where we live.</p>  <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>We are wanting to attract everyone. Especially those who are interested in conservation, emergency preparedness, saving money, etc. It may relate to gardeners, people who have outdoor animals, people preparing to have a food and water supply in cases of emergency, and those who care about the planet.</p>  <!-- change this -->

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Water conservation and storage
        Our planet is made up of mostly water. Water equals life. Every living thing on this earth depends on water is some form or another. As the world's population grows, climates change, and pollution abounds we will continue to see the worlds most precious resource: clean, useable water, dwindle.

        We rely on clean water more than most of us would like to realize. The average american household uses about 80 gallons per person per day. We need to clean our bodies, our food, our dishes, clothes, and homes. More importantly we need water to drink and cook with. A recommended standard is to store a gallon per person per day for emergencies. For a family of 5 for one week that would be 35 gallons of water, which would only cover drinking water.

        Another way to save and conserve water for the yard and garden would be to use a rain barrel system to help water plants. Also using a drip system is much more effective at watering plants and decreasing runoff and evaporation. There are also clay pots called ollas that are buried into the garden bed and then filled with water. As the soil around the olla dries the water seeps from the clay pot and waters the roots of the plants surrounding it. Hugelkulture is another way to save water by burying branches and wood and mounding up the ground over it to create a hill. Then plants are grown on the hill and the materials underneath the soil retain the water and also decompose creating a healthier soil. Lastly, there are ways to plant which create the need to water less. Xerixcaping is the process of using plants and rocks and mulch to cover much of the ground creating less areas needing to be watered. Often this type of landscaping uses plants which are considered drought tolerant. This means they can go extended periods of time without being watered and need less water than other types of plants.
