    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Clean, useable water is such an important resource! One we often take for granted.  In the area where I live there is a drought, and there has been for decades. Have you ever thought what it would be like to have a very limited supply of clean water for your use? What would happen if we couldn’t quickly go to the sink and get water to drink or to wash our hands? My goal is to identify ways to easily conserve water. I want my website to demonstrate through word, picture, and video; ways to conserve water. I would also like to sell products to help facilitate conserving water. Some of those products would be: 1-clay pitcher like pots that you bury in the ground and then fill with water, to keep the roots of nearby plants moist (This lessens the need to water from above and creates less wasted water). 2-hardware to create rain barrel systems to collect rainwater. 3- Water purifying devices.  I would also show ways to plant which require less watering. Some examples are hügelkultur or xeriscaping. Also including native and/or drought resistant plants will help as well. There are many ways to conserve water for ourselves for emergencies and/or personal use, while still creating a beautiful garden, or yard where we live.</p>  <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>We are wanting to attract everyone. Especially those who are interested in conservation, emergency preparedness, saving money, etc. It may relate to gardeners, people who have outdoor animals, people preparing to have a food and water supply in cases of emergency, and those who care about the planet.</p>  <!-- change this -->

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
