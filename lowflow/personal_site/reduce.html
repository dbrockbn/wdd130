        <h1> Ways to reduce water in the yard and garden</h1>
        <p>"Ollas are clay pitcher like pots that you bury in the ground and then fill with water, to keep the roots of nearby plants moist (This lessens the need to water from above and creates less wasted water). Creating a rain barrel system to collect rainwater to be used later for irrigation, water storage, or water for animals. Did you know that there are even ways to plant which require less watering? Some examples are hügelkultur or xeriscaping. Hugelkultur involves burying pieces of trees, shrubs, <and>
        /or plant materials in a mound or hill and planting over the top of it. By planting this way, you will have to water much less and the dirt is also improved by the decomposing materials underneath. Xeriscaping is a way to landscape and plant that requires little or no irrigation or other maintenance. Often it involves rocks and hardscaping. Another way to beautify your yard in ways that require less water are to include native and/or drought tolerant plants. There are many ways to conserve water for ourselves for emergencies and/or personal use, while still creating a beautiful garden, or yard where we live."
