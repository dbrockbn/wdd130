    <P>Hello. I am an Applied Technology major and grateful to be back at BYUI through advancepath. I attended BYUI after highschool... a long time ago, and met my husband there. When we graduated we had one child and another on the way. We now have 6 children ages 17-4. Ive been blessed to be a stay at home mom during this time and now that my youngest will be starting school, its time for me to go back to school. I'm excited but also a little nervous.  </P>
    <P>I have been a member of the church since I was baptized as an 8 year old, by my father. I feel very blessed to have been raised in the gospel by loving parents who taught me to love our Heavenly Father and our Savior Jesus Christ. One of my alltime favorite scriptures is Philippians 4 verse 13: I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.  </P>
    <P>Some of the things I love to do are garden, draw, craft, and spend time with my husband and kids</P>
    <P>I am really enjoying being able to virtually be back at BYU Idaho. As I have started these courses, I have really felt the spirit and I am so grateful for the opportunity to be here.</P>
